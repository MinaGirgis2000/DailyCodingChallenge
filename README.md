# DailyCodingChallenge

In an effort to continuously strengthen my coding skills, I will be doing Daily Coding Challenge Â®'s 2024 daily puzzles - starting 4/14/2024.
I will be using Python and Java for these challenges.
I am open to help/criticism! Please let me know whenever my code is incorrect/inefficient in any way.

If you are interested in doing the same, follow <a href="https://www.dailycodingchallenge.dev/subscribe?ref=ZmDD4DOAsr">this link</a>.

Happy coding!
