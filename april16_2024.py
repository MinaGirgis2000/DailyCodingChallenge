# Challenge Overview: You are tasked with designing a queue system that can handle varied priorities, ensuring that higher-priority items are processed first, 
# yet still allowing lower-priority items to be addressed in a timely manner. Your challenge is to balance efficiency with fairness in this optimized queue.

# Challenge Objectives:

#     Develop a priority queue algorithm that dynamically adjusts to varying priority levels, ensuring an optimal balance between prioritization and fairness.

#     Your solution should highlight algorithmic efficiency, scalability, and adaptability to changing conditions.

#     Document your approach and the rationale behind your design choices, offering insights into how this optimized queue could be applied in real-world scenarios. 

# Guidelines:

#     Select any programming language that allows you to effectively demonstrate your algorithmic prowess and clarity of thought.

#     Test your priority queue under different scenarios to ensure robustness and performance consistency.

#     Reflect on the broader implications of your queue design, considering potential applications and the impact of your optimization strategies.
