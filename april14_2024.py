# Challenge Overview: Your challenge is to develop an algorithm for topological sorting of a directed acyclic graph (DAG). This sorting will help determine an order in 
# which tasks or steps should be undertaken, considering all given dependencies. Perfect for scenarios where you need to respect prerequisites, your algorithm 
# should clarify the sequence in which nodes should be processed.

# Challenge Objectives:

#     Implement a robust topological sort algorithm that handles various graph structures and sizes, ensuring all dependencies are respected in the output order.

#     Showcase the efficiency and clarity of your approach, emphasizing how it can be applied in real-world dependency resolution scenarios.

#     Elaborate on your strategy and thought process, offering insights into the utility and applications of topological sorting beyond theoretical contexts. 

# Guidelines:

#     Choose any programming language that enables you to best express your algorithmic solutions and articulate your thought process.

#     Test your implementation across different DAG configurations to ensure its versatility and accuracy.

#     Discuss the implications of your solution, considering its impact on project scheduling, task sequencing, or any relevant domain.
